# The distance (m) and time (s) travelled by three projectiles were recorded in
# an experiment.  Write a Python code to build a table that adequately displays
# the data on the three projectiles: distance, time and velocity (that you must
# obtain by the distance and the time travelled)
# 202 m; 7.5s; v m/s
# 14 m; 2.5s; v m/s
# 312 m; 8.5s; v m/s
